    "## Project Purpose\n",
    "- NBA games are very popular. Of course people always root for their home team and anxious for the result. For some people, the results of these games are extra important if they have engaged in betting. There has many studies focus on this field. As a matter of fact, there are some websites running simulation to provide suggestions for people to betting. However, these websites are actually not free, like http://www.nbagamesim.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We found this topic interesting and would like to build our own model to simulate the game results. Lots of academic paper shows that Possion distribution would be a good approximation to the dynamics of soccor game. Given the similar nature of sports game results, we think the Poisson process would be a good estimation for basketball game as well. In this project, we will implement the model based on Poisson distribution and see how well the model could predict the actual result."

    "## Project Structure and Details\n",
    "- Data collecting\n",
    "    - Use Beautiful Soup to collect historical NBA scores from www.basketball-reference.com/. The data includes the game data of 2014-2015 season, 2015-2016 season and 2016-2017 season of all the NBA teams.\n",
    "    - The function *get_table* works as a scraper to grab data from our source webside. Information includes: home team and their score, and away team and their score.\n",
    "    - The function *get_table* is a general function to scrape information from the website. Then we apply this function on specific year and month. Then merge the data altogether, and delete the useless data, to form the raw data table that would be used in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data manipulation\n",
    "    - After we get the raw data table, we add the score difference and score sum of each game to the table.\n",
    "    - Then, we extract the a list of NBA team names from the raw table, which will be used to construct the 'battle form' later.\n",
    "    - From the team name table, we then construct 'A team' vs 'B team' as the index of the ''battle form. Separate columns for away team and home team are also specified in the 'battle form'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation calculation\n",
    "    - In this stage, we created the 'Team' class to calculate some other detail parameters of each game, as well as other sample parameters that will be fed into the simulation later.\n",
    "    - The constructor initializes the parameters, including pinpointing relating data cells, average and variance of score sum, and variance of score difference.\n",
    "    - The *sscore* method calculate the average sum of scores scored and conceded by team. And the *difscore* method calculate the average (scored-conceded) per game for team.\n",
    "    - Then, we calculate the parameters *delta_g* and *sigma_g* using *difscore* and *sscore* methods respectively, and append the result to a data frame.\n",
    "    - Another class, 'Game', is created to facilitate the cimulation process.\n",
    "    - As shown in the class constructor, it takes into two team names to initiate the simulation process. \n",
    "    - According the model that has been specified in the following section, the *sim_result* method calculate the g parameters in the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation\n",
    "    - We use *all_sim* function to run the simulation. *one_game* is an instance from the *Game* class, and we call the *sim_result* method to generate the simulation result.\n",
    "    - After the simulation, we wrote the result into a csv file, which has been sumitted in our project zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model acuracy test\n",
    "    - To have a better understanding regarding how our model works, we use *test* function to compare the simulation result and the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- User interaction\n",
    "    - As described in the project purpose section, we want to provide a tool for basketball lovers to predict the game result. Hence, the last part of our project is designed for user interaction. Users can specify the teams of a certain match that they are interested in, and we will print out our prediction result for the users."

    "## Underlying Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, our analysis relies on recent obsercations in describing the teams: \n",
    "1. The home advantage is characterized by a team-independent but season-dependent increase of the home team score difference $c_{home} > 0$\n",
    "2. An appropriate observable to characterize the fitness of a team i in a given season is the average goal difference (normalized per match) $\\Delta G_i(N)$, i.e. the difference of the goals scored and conceded during N matches. In particular it contains more information about the team fitness than, e.g., the number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "So firstly, we would like to use our game data to compute $\\Delta G_i(N)$ and $\\sum G_i(N)$, which can be represented by the score difference and score sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As an immediate consequence, the limit of $\\Delta G_i(N)$ for large N, corresponding to the true fitness $\\Delta G_i$, is well-defined. Since we only have finite sample N games to compute $\\Delta G_i(N)$, the consistent estimator for $\\Delta G_i$, based on $\\Delta G_i(N)$, reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\Delta G_i = a_N\\Delta G_i(N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    with $a_N = 1/[1+3/(N\\sigma^2_{\\Delta G})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analogously, introducing $\\sum G_i(N)$ as the average sum of goals scored and conceded by team i in N matches. \n",
    "    - The long-term limit can be estimated estimated via $\\Delta G_i - \\xi = b_N(\\sum G_i(N)-\\xi)$\n",
    "    with $b_N = 1/[1+3/(N\\sigma^2_{\\sum G})]$, where $\\xi$ is the average number of goals per match in the respective season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "Then, we would like to compute parameter $g_{i,j}$.\n",
    "$$ g_{i,j}=g_i-g_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g_{i,j}$ express goal difference of a match of team i vs. team j with the final result $g_i:g_j$. $g_i$ denotes our final simulation result for team i's score, $g_j$ denotes team j's score. Here we set team i to be the away team and team j to be the home team. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_{i,j}$ denotes for the external influences of a specific match, i.e. weather components, health conditions, which would be hard to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, here we only consider the influence of the main component $q_{i,j}$, as $f_{i,j}$ is hard to evaluate. So:\n",

    "$$g_{i,j} = q_{i,j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "<br /> \n",

    "\n",
    "- $q_{i,j}$ would need to fulfill the basic conditions (taking into account the home advantage):\n",
    "    -  symmetry condition: $$ q_{i,j} - c_{home} = -(q_{j,i} - c_{home})$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most general and simple formula of estimate of $g_{i,j}$ (denoted by $\\widetilde g_{i,j}$) could be given as follow.\n",
    "$$ g_{i,j} = g_{i} - g{j}= g_{awayteam} - g_{hometeam}$$\n",

    "<br /> \n",

However, during our other courseworks, we found that R would outperform at statistical modelling and fitting (the packages are more accurate). Also, for very speed-demanding and complicated programs, it would be better to use C++. Every programming language has its own strength, and picking the right one would be very helpful in solving the whole problem. "
